# Farm The Ingots

A 1.20.1-fabric modpack focusing on Tech & Farming.

This is a fabric modpack on Minecraft 1.20.1, focusing on Tech and Farming.

In this modpack, you can literally plant every minerals from all kinds of magic seeds.
With farming, you could build grand multi-block machines, explore all the danger, and even go to the space!

This modpack contains full guidance (including issue resolver) in the FTB quest book, so you really need to read that book very often.

# Client installation

You are suggested to use [Hello! Minecraft Launcher 3](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL/releases).

1. Download the latest version of the modpack zip.
2. Drag the zip file into HMCL.
3. To optimize threading, you may change settings `Settings->Video Settings->Performance->Thread`. Half of the maximum is recommended.

2. Unzip the file to a prepared directory, you may not change it later.
3. There is an integrated `server.properties`, if you want to change some properties, do it here.
4. Run `start.bat`. If your default java is not java 17 (or higher), specify `java_path` by edit this file.
5. An `eula.txt` file generated on the first launch, change `eula=false` to `enla=true` to show agreement to the End-user License Agreement from Mojang.
6. Rerun `start.bat`.

# FTI Essential Features
